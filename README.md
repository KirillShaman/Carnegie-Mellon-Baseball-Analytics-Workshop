# Carnegie Mellon Baseball Analytics Workshop

This repository contains materials for the [Carnegie Mellon University Baseball Analytics Workshop](https://cmusportsanalytics.com/workshop.html), to be held on April 7th 2018 by the [CMU Statistics \& Data Science Department](http://www.stat.cmu.edu/) and [Carnegie Mellon Sports Analytics Club](https://www.cmusportsanalytics.com/).

The first half of the workshop focuses on working with the `Lahman` package to learn basic `R` data exploration techniques (using the `dplyr` and `ggplot2` packages).

The second half of the workshop uses PITCHf/x and Statcast data to generate a game plan for the Pirates against the Reds. This involves exploring the pitch-by-pitch data, to identify tendencies in the Reds hitters from their strengths and weaknesses against certain pitches, to where they are most likely to hit the ball.
